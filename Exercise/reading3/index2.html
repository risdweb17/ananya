<h2> Captives of the Cloud </h2>
<p> 
Consciously, I have only used the cloud to store my phone data such as messages, videos, pictures, and contacts on i-cloud which is a saviour for your data when it comes to changing a device or using some other device to access the information. Because there is so much data that I would like to store, the limitation to the storage on cloud would make me run for external hard drives; one has to pay to get more space on cloud as storage is limited.  </p>

<p>On the other hand, we are involved in cloud-based social networking platforms and by digitalization of stores, books, and videos; the amount of information one has access to is immense. We are all unconsciously sharing data on various portals. Privacy plays a predominant role, and no one wants policing of any kind, but above all comes the security and peace of the state and country. The Internet has become a very convenient source of communication and exchange of information. There is a lot of data floating that is potentially harmful to masses. Videos of child pornography, numerous websites for pirated movies and TV shows resulting in loss of millions of dollars, easy access to videos on “how to make a bomb” or “methods to commit suicide”; involving lives of individuals. </p>

<p>Instead of bringing everyone under a cloud of suspicion, have various governments built up a system to monitor criminal activities or to determine whether someone’s internet communications are related to the same, to somehow sort through the huge amount of internet traffic by picking up key words? </p>
