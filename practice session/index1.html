		<p><em>Choose and study</em> <!-- an inline element --> a “default” of the web and either enhance it or subvert it. Whether you are subverting or enhancing the behavior, be deliberate; the site should demonstrate self-consciousness in its mode of construction.
		Pick a system, convention, or trend of the web (either past or present.) Study its iterations.
		Map out your website, structuring your content based on your research. How would people navigate between your pages? What choices are you presenting to the user? If helpful, create a quick sketch in Illustrator / Photoshop.
		<strong>Develop your site</strong> in HTML & CSS. How does the visual and interactive language support the content? </p>

		<p>In this project, you will be creating a web-based version of your resume. Feel free to make it as dry or expressive as you see fit. Think about your audience — what kind of people with whom you will be sharing this page.</p>
